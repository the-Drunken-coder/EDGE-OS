# TASK-001: Build Camera Detection and Person Tracking System

## Description
Develop a system that:
- Starts up and searches for any connected cameras on the system
- Opens the detected camera
- Detects people in the camera`s field of vision using computer vision techniques
- Calculates and outputs the bearing (azimuth) and elevation of detected people relative to the camera
- Outputs this data to the ATLAS system via telemetry (to be integrated later)
