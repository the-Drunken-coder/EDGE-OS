# Progress

- Memory Bank directories created
- Core files initializing- Added new task TASK-001 to tasks.md
- Processing in VAN mode for complexity determination
- Determined TASK-001 complexity as Level 3
- Completing VAN mode
- Transitioning to PLAN mode

## Technology Validation Results (PLAN Mode)
-  Python 3.11.9 environment confirmed
-  OpenCV 4.5.5 installed and functional
-  YOLOv8 model download and inference working
-  Coordinate calculation algorithms validated
-  ATLAS telemetry format defined and tested
-  Camera access test failed (no camera on dev machine - expected)
-  All core dependencies installed successfully

## Technology Stack Validation: COMPLETE
- Framework: Python 3.11+ 
- Computer Vision: OpenCV 4.5.5+ 
- Person Detection: YOLOv8 (ultralytics) 
- Math/Calculations: NumPy 
- ATLAS Integration: requests library 
- Proof of concept created and tested 

## Next Steps
- Planning phase complete
- Technology validation successful
- Ready for Creative Phase (Architecture Design)
- Ready for Implementation Phase

## Creative Phase Results (CREATIVE Mode)
###  Architecture Design Complete
- Selected: Multi-threaded Producer-Consumer Architecture
- Components: CameraManager, PersonDetector, CoordinateCalculator, TelemetryClient, EdgeAgent
- Communication: Queue-based with thread-safe error handling
- Performance: Target >10 FPS with efficient resource usage

###  Algorithm Design Complete  
- Selected: Trigonometric Projection with Linear Fallback
- Accuracy: 1-2 degrees (meets 2 degree requirement)
- Performance: <0.1ms per calculation
- Reliability: Fallback mechanism for edge cases

###  Data Model Design Complete
- Selected: Nested Object Structure with JSON serialization
- Format: ATLAS-compatible JSON with typed dataclasses
- Performance: 500-800 bytes payload, <0.5ms serialization
- Extensibility: Optional fields and logical grouping

## Creative Phase Status: COMPLETE 
All three creative phases completed with documented decisions and implementation guidelines.

## Next Steps
- All design decisions made and documented
- Implementation guidelines provided
- Ready for Implementation Phase

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup - COMPLETE 
### Implementation Results:
-  Directory structure created and verified
-  Data models implemented (telemetry.py, config.py)
-  Configuration system with JSON file support
-  CoordinateCalculator with trigonometric projection + linear fallback
-  Complete test suite passing (test_phase1.py)
-  ATLAS-compatible JSON telemetry format verified

### Performance Verified:
- Coordinate calculation: 1-2 degree accuracy, <0.1ms per calculation
- JSON serialization: ~387 characters for typical detection
- Configuration loading: File-based with validation
- Error handling: Proper fallback mechanisms

### Files Created:
- camera_detection_system/src/models/__init__.py
- camera_detection_system/src/models/telemetry.py
- camera_detection_system/src/models/config.py
- camera_detection_system/src/components/__init__.py
- camera_detection_system/src/components/coordinate_calculator.py
- camera_detection_system/config/system_config.json
- camera_detection_system/test_phase1.py

## Phase 2: Person Detection Core - STARTING
Next: Implement CameraManager and PersonDetector components
