# Active Context

Current mode: IMPLEMENT (Phase 1 Complete)
Current task: TASK-001 - Build Camera Detection and Person Tracking System

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup - COMPLETE 
-  Directory structure created and verified
-  Data models implemented (telemetry.py, config.py)
-  Configuration system with JSON file support
-  CoordinateCalculator with trigonometric projection + linear fallback
-  Complete test suite passing (test_phase1.py)
-  ATLAS-compatible JSON telemetry format verified

## Phase 2: Person Detection Core - READY TO START
Next steps:
- Implement CameraManager component (camera discovery and capture)
- Implement PersonDetector component (YOLO-based detection)
- Create Phase 2 test suite
- Verify real-time detection pipeline

## Implementation Status
- Phase 1: Foundation Setup  COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Person Detection Core  NEXT
- Phase 3: Coordinate Calculations  PENDING
- Phase 4: ATLAS Integration  PENDING
- Phase 5: System Integration  PENDING
